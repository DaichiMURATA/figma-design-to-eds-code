# EDS Block Generation Rules - Figma MCP Integration Template

## Automated Block Generation with Figma MCP

When the user requests to generate a block, use the following workflow:

### 1. User Input Options

**Option A: Figma Only (Simplest)**
```
@figma https://www.figma.com/design/MJTwyRbE5EVdlci3UIwsut/...?node-id=2-1446

Generate EDS Block for "Accordion"
```
- Extract all requirements from Figma design
- Component name, variants, design tokens, layout structure
- Infer accessibility requirements from component structure

**Option B: Figma + User Story (Recommended for complex blocks)**
```
"Generate hero block:
- Figma: https://www.figma.com/design/MJTwyRbE5EVdlci3UIwsut/...?node-id=2-1446
- User Story: docs/user-stories/hero-block.md"
```
- Figma provides visual design and variants
- User Story provides detailed functional and accessibility requirements

**Option C: Template-style Request**
```
@figma https://www.figma.com/design/...?node-id=XXX
@file docs/user-stories/hero-block.md  # Optional

Generate EDS Block
```

### 2. Automatic Processing

When user provides inputs:
- Access Figma design via MCP `@figma` integration
- Read User Story markdown file
- Extract block name from User Story or Figma component name
- Read `.cursorrules`, `BLOCK-GENERATION-GUIDE.md`, `VISUAL-REGRESSION-STRATEGY.md`
- Generate block files directly

### 3. Generation Steps

**Parse User Input:**
- Figma URL (required): Extract from `@figma` or prompt
- User Story path (optional): Path to markdown file, if provided
- Block name (optional): Auto-detect from Figma component name or files

**Information Extraction:**

From Figma (via MCP) - Always:
- Component name and Variants
- Design tokens (colors, typography, spacing)
- Layout structure and dimensions
- Interactive elements and states
- Infer interaction behavior from component structure

From User Story (markdown) - If provided:
- Detailed functional requirements
- Specific interaction requirements  
- Edge case handling
- Custom accessibility requirements
- Specific test scenarios

**When User Story is NOT provided:**
- Infer requirements from Figma component structure
- Use EDS Block Collection patterns (https://github.com/adobe/aem-block-collection)
- Reference Adobe's standard block implementations
- Apply default accessibility standards (WCAG AA)
- Generate test scenarios based on Figma Variants

**Code Generation:**
1. Read project context from `BLOCK-GENERATION-GUIDE.md`
2. Read Visual Regression strategy from `VISUAL-REGRESSION-STRATEGY.md`
3. Reference EDS Block Collection for standard patterns:
   - Accordion: https://github.com/adobe/aem-block-collection/tree/main/blocks/accordion
   - Tabs: https://github.com/adobe/aem-block-collection/tree/main/blocks/tabs
   - Carousel: https://github.com/adobe/aem-block-collection/tree/main/blocks/carousel
   - Cards: https://github.com/adobe/aem-block-collection/tree/main/blocks/cards
4. Check available design tokens (styles/*.css)
5. Generate the three files directly:
   - `blocks/<name>/<name>.js`
   - `blocks/<name>/<name>.css`
   - `blocks/<name>/<name>.stories.js`

### 4. STORYBOOK STORY GENERATION STRATEGY

**CRITICAL**: Figma is the Single Source of Truth

**Story Generation Rule:**
```
Figma Variants count = Storybook Stories count (1:1 mapping)
```

**What to Generate:**
- ✅ **One Story per Figma Variant** - No more, no less
- ✅ **Story names match Figma Variant property values**
- ✅ **All visual states must be defined in Figma as Variants**

**What NOT to Generate:**
- ❌ Do NOT add extra stories for edge cases (minimal/maximum content)
- ❌ Do NOT add extra stories for interaction states (hover/focus/active) unless in Figma
- ❌ Do NOT add extra stories for responsive breakpoints unless in Figma
- ❌ Do NOT add extra stories for error/loading/empty states unless in Figma

**Figma Design Requirements** (Designer responsibility):
Each Figma Component Set should include Variants for:
- All interaction states (default, hover, focus, active, disabled)
- All content states (error, loading, empty) if applicable
- All responsive breakpoints (desktop, tablet, mobile) if needed
- All content variations (minimal, normal, maximum) if needed

**Note:** If Figma lacks certain variants (e.g., focus state), this indicates the design needs to be updated in Figma first, NOT added in code generation.

**Visual Regression Coverage:**
- Each Story export → One Chromatic snapshot
- Chromatic captures screenshots of all Story exports
- Use `parameters.chromatic.viewports: [375, 1200]` for responsive testing within a single Story

### 5. Example User Commands

**Format 1: Figma Only (Simplest)**
```
@figma https://www.figma.com/design/ABC123/Components?node-id=100-200

Generate EDS Block for "Accordion"
```

**Format 2: Figma Only with Block Name**
```
@figma https://www.figma.com/design/ABC123/Components?node-id=100-200

Generate EDS Block for "Hero" with variants: Default, Centered, FullWidth
```

**Format 3: Figma + User Story (Recommended for complex blocks)**
```
"Generate tabs block:
- Figma: https://www.figma.com/design/ABC123/Components?node-id=100-200
- User Story: docs/user-stories/tabs-block.md"
```

**Format 4: Template with @figma**
```
@figma https://www.figma.com/design/ABC123/Components?node-id=100-200
@file docs/user-stories/tabs-block.md  # Optional

Generate EDS Block
```

### 6. Files to Read (In Order of Priority)

1. **Figma design** (via MCP) - REQUIRED - Visual design and variants
2. **User Story markdown** (if provided) - OPTIONAL - Detailed requirements and test scenarios
3. **BLOCK-GENERATION-GUIDE.md** - REQUIRED - Comprehensive block generation rules (PRIMARY REFERENCE)
4. **VISUAL-REGRESSION-STRATEGY.md** - REQUIRED - Storybook story strategy for Chromatic
5. **EDS Block Collection** - REQUIRED - Adobe's standard block implementations
   - GitHub: https://github.com/adobe/aem-block-collection
   - Use as pattern reference for standard blocks (Accordion, Tabs, Carousel, Cards, etc.)
6. **Style tokens** (styles/*.css) - Available design tokens
7. **scripts/aem.js** - Available helper functions

**When User Story is not provided:**
- Rely on Figma design for all visual and structural requirements
- Infer behavior from EDS Block Collection standard patterns
- Map component name to standard EDS block type:
  - Accordion → Standard expand/collapse pattern
  - Tabs → Standard tab switching pattern
  - Carousel → Standard slideshow pattern
  - Hero → Standard hero section pattern
- Apply standard accessibility patterns (WCAG AA) for component type
- Reference AEM.live documentation: https://www.aem.live/docs/

### 7. Post-Generation Steps

Automatically remind user:
1. Review generated files
2. Run Storybook locally: `npm run storybook`
3. Verify Visual Regression stories cover all Figma variants
4. Test accessibility and responsiveness
5. Create PR for Chromatic Visual Regression testing

## No Manual Copy-Paste Required

The AI should automatically handle:
- Accessing Figma design via MCP
- Reading User Story markdown
- Applying generation rules from guides
- Generating all block files (JS, CSS, Stories)
- Providing next steps

Just provide Figma URL and User Story path!
